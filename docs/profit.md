description: 'Who is paying trader profits?'

Trading is usually refered to as a zero-sum game because one person gaining is equivalent to someone else losing. This in the long-term means traders are paying each other out. 
Now in the beginning where there is a disbalance of traders or more are just profiting than losing the exchange is the one that pays out.



The overall collateral Model

(((((((Longs / Shorts ) - Trading Loss Backup Fund) Funding rate ) Synchronizer Balance) DEA Insurance Fund) Vaults ) DEUS ETH Treasury)


## Where Do These Profits come from?

In the event there is more profits than losses from traders the exchange relies on Vaults, these vaults are overcollaterized by a certain percentage lets say for example: 350% that would mean for every $1 being traded there has to be $3.50 locked. 
In the very rare case of traders still profiting more than this there is was an Insurance Fund created.
