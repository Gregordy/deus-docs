## What is DEUS?

DEUS finance is a DeFi protocol that enables users to hold and trade blockchain derivatives of traditional assets such as stocks and indices on the Ethereum network.

## How does DEUS work?

It works through Registrars, virtual copies of assets or baskets of assets, pegged 1:1 to their real-world equivalents. Each Registrar is represented with its own ERC-20 token (wToken). The current market value of assets is continuously provided to the system via oracles. Traders invest in Registrars through a platform called DEUS Swap, our decentralized exchange.

## Why DEUS?

### As a Trader
- Little to no Slippage
- Users can trade without providing collateral
- No KYC
- Assets moveable as ERC-20 Tokens
- [AMM](amm)

### As a Liquidity Provider
- Losses and fees from Traders
- Earlier access to certain IPO's or stocks
- Governance/voting power in the Dao
- More liquidity means more trading, which grows ecosystem benefiting Deus and Dea price


## Why two tokens?

[DEUS](deus.md) – A share in the Ecosystem. Benefits from constant buybacks. (less volatility).

[DEA](dea) – A liquidity pair in all farming pools, needed for max returns on trading fees. Low supply, high demand (higher volatility).


## Where to buy? 
We do not advise users to buy from Uniswap. High slippage may occur and trading on Uniswap will not affect the bonding curve of the DEUS Swap Market Maker. Instead, we encourage you to buy DEUS directly through [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap) to empower and support the DEUS ecosystem. 

*If you'd still rather purchase on Uniswap, you're obviously free to do so, but please watch out for FAKE-clone-tokens. Always make sure you are buying the token by checking the contract address.*
