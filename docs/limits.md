title: Synchronizer Capacity    
description: What is the Synchronizer capacity?
---



The DEUS System is currently still in the Trial Phase. There is currently at a stage where we have chosen a 1300% over collateral rate. <br/>
The System will be observed & monitored and after 4 weeks, cap will be lowered. <br/>
And then again reviewed and lowered.



### Example:
For every 
100 Dollar in the Vaults <br/>
7.692 Dollar can be traded in the Synchronizer, <br/>
creating the "Synchronizer Capacity." <br/>


The over collateral rate will lower over time.

1. Crypto Positions are counted 4x
2. Stock Positions are counted 2x
3. Forex Positions are counted 1x <br/>

The first trial phase will be going for 4 weeks.


Buying uses capacity.
Selling frees up capacity again.




### Look into the future

Until the policy will evolve into the "Funding System" over the course of the next months.
The funding system will make the capacity more free-flowing as it adjusts itself every hour to the current ratio of Longs / Shorts.

The documentation on this is currently written and peer-reviewed.
