#### What is a Registrar?

Registrars are decentralized tools that behave similarly to derivatives but leveraging smart contract technology. They utilize a real-time price feed of any asset or basket of assets gathered from oracles and create a new kind of asset class, whose price correlates with the underlying asset. 

Registrars enable investors to trade any real-world asset on decentralized blockchains. They will be chain-agnostic, meaning we can quickly implement them on any chain.

The constant price correlation is achieved through an automated internal pricing mechanism that uses oracles, which feed data from the markets into the blockchain. 

The Registrars are backed by the DEUS ecosystemâ€™s treasury & reserve, and by the balancing mechanism of our governance token, DEA. You can find more in the Tokenomics section.


#### Who gets to create Registrars?
At launch, QQQ and Tesla will be available on the Conductor, regular and inverted. Registrars for the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DAX will eventually become available.

Over time, variety will increase, and anyone will be able to create Registrars through our platform. To ensure sustainable growth their implementation has to happen gradually, and there will be limits on how many Registrars can exist at once.
