The assets we will add have all been verified by Standard & Poor’s before being added to the S&P 500. The 500th rank on their list still has a market cap of around 8 billion, which ensures minimal volatility.

The Council members will prepare detailed risk assessment strategies for future implementations of Registrars.

High-risk Registrars will not be mixed with low-risk Registrars, so Liquidity providers can decide on the risks they want to take.

#### Beta — a risk indicator

“Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk of a security or a portfolio compared to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets (usually stocks). 

CAPM is widely used as a method for pricing risky securities and generating estimates of the expected returns of assets, considering both the risk of those assets and capital costs.”

#### Volatility Index

“The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a measure of expected price fluctuations in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. The VIX, often termed as the “fear index,” is calculated in real-time by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).”

The key words in that description are “expected” and “next 30 days”. The predictive nature of the VIX makes it a measure of implied volatility, not one that is based on historical data or statistical analysis. The time period of the prediction also narrows the outlook to the near term.
