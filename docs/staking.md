The DEUS Ecosystem rewards liquidity providers by allowing users to stake their sealed tokens(sTokens) or Balancer pool tokens (bpt). The users staking collect rewards from an arbitrage bot in the Balancer pools along with fees and losses of traders.

## What is the main difference between the single and Balancer pool?

[single pool](https://app.deus.finance/staking/single) (sDEUS, sDEA, Time token):
- No risks of impermanent loss but less rewards.
- Simple as taking [sTokens](vaults) or [Time tokens](timetoken) and pressing "Stake Here".

[Balancer pool](https://app.deus.finance/staking/liquidity):
- Some risks of impermanent loss but much higher rewards.
- Can provide the multiple different assets for the least slippage or enter through the single asset with some slippage, but easier process.
